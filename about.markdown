# About Me

Hi, I'm Jose W Orozco, an Electronics engineer based in Costa Rica. I specialize in VLSI logic IP design and have a passion for Music. With more than 20 of experience in Semiconductors, I enjoy creating innovative solutions and sharing knowledge with others.

When I'm not working, you can find me studing musical instruments, reading, coding side projects. I'm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on exciting projects.

Feel free to reach out to me via https://www.linkedin.com/in/jworozco/.

Thanks for visiting my page!
